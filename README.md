## Development

Run the dev server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

To run Wrangler:

```sh
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Typegen

Generate types for your Cloudflare bindings in `wrangler.toml`:

```sh
npm run typegen
```

You will need to rerun typegen whenever you make changes to `wrangler.toml`.

## Deployment

> [!WARNING]
> Cloudflare does _not_ use `wrangler.toml` to configure deployment bindings.
> You **MUST** [configure deployment bindings manually in the Cloudflare dashboard][bindings].

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then, deploy your app to Cloudflare Pages:

```sh
npm run deploy
```
